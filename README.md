# Working with the React Boilerplate project

This application was created by completing the "Building Scalable React Apps" course by Hendrik Swanepoel on Pluralsight.

**Functionality:**

It is a course management application where you can view a list of courses with appropriate links and descriptions. You can navigate to different pages through a navigation bar and React Router. You can also add new courses through an input form (with appropriate validation). Finally, you can 'log in' to the application and it will display the entered email address in the top right.

**Technical Info:**

The project utilizes React Boilerplate and thus uses the following technologies:

- React
- Redux
- Redux Saga
- React Router
- ESLint
- Babel
- Webpack
- Node/NPM
- Reselect
- Immutable-js
- Bootstrap
